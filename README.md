## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To create maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, I divided my code into individual methods and used the simplest built-in Python modules to achieve my goal. Additionally, I used simple explanatory function names to clarify the purpose of each function. To ensure that the code became understandable, I included comments for each method and if there was a particularly complex portion of the method.

After creating the CRUD module, I regularly tested the functions in the Jupyter notebook to ensure that they were still working properly and met my requirements.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I approach most problems in a similar way. I make sure that I can clearly understand a client's requirements and ask questions if I do not fully understand certain requirements or sections of a requirement. I divide problems into smaller, more manageable tasks unless the problem is already as small as it can be. I also make sure to use an iterative development process that can include updating to a new technology and reviewing best practices that have recently been released. I approached this project in a relatively similar way, identifying our overall goal, determining the small pieces that needed to be built, and iteratively updating the notebook with new sections of code.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists wear many hats. We strive for efficiency, streamline processing with software, ensure that companies have readily available data to make informed decisions, and constantly adapt to changing coding environments, business requirements, or project solutions. The work that I completed on this project would enable similar companies to identify their data more readily without having to create complicated database queries themselves or read individual sets of data. This project made the data from Grazioso Salvare more digestible for the average user.
